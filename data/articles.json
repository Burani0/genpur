He lives with his parents and 7 other siblings - 4 sisters and 3 brothers. From the beginning, Thomas approached the world with curiosity, but the educational system wasn't always equipped to support his unique needs.",

            "text": "His primary challenges were not just physical, but also social and systemic. He struggled with mobility within a standard school environment, and the lack of accessible learning materials made classroom participation difficult. Furthermore, he often faced social isolation, finding it difficult to join in physical activities during break time or games time, which affected his confidence and engagement in school.\n\nThe core challenge was ensuring Thomas could access the same quality of education and social experiences as his peers without feeling limited by his condition. Due to lack of a wheelchair to support him with mobility to school, Thomas missed school for two terms. His mother, who is elderly and ailing, was unable to escort him to school on a daily basis.",

Through this, he will sell the vegetables and save towards his school fees.\n\n\"Seeing Thomas come home excited about school every day is the greatest gift. The support didn't just change his school life; it changed our family's outlook on his future.\" - Thomas's Mother"
